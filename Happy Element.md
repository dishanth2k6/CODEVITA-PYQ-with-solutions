Problem :Happy Element
Given an array of integers A, and an integer K find a number of happy elements. Element X is happy if there exists at least 1 element whose difference is less than K i.e. an element X is happy if there is another element in the range [X-K, X+K] other than X itself.

Constraints 1 <= N <= 10^5 0 <= K <= 10^5 0 <= A[i] <= 10^9

Input The first line contains two integers N and K where N is the size of the array and K is a number as described above. The second line contains N integers separated by space.

Output Print a single integer denoting the total number of happy elements.
